A better approach than categorizing a p-value is thus to transform a\np-value to a Bayes factor or a lower bound on a Bayes factor, a so-called minimum Bayes factor\n(Goodman 1999b). But many such ways have been proposed to calibrate p-values, and there is\ncurrently no consensus on how p-values should be transformed to Bayes factors.\nFirst, there is an important distinction between tests for direction and tests for existence\n(Marsman & Wagenmakers 2017).
